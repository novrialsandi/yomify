## About

Yomify: Wedding Invitation is an interactive wedding invitation that provides a unique experience for guests. Instead of simply displaying wedding details directly, this invitation encourages guests to interact with various image objects scattered throughout the invitation page.

Each object plays a special role in conveying wedding details. For example:

- Calendar → Displays the wedding date and time.
- Map or Location Pin → Provides information about the venue and directions to the event.
- Wedding Rings → Shares a brief love story of the couple.
- Envelope or Gift → Provides details about gifts or digital angpao.

With this concept, guests don’t just receive an invitation—they also enjoy the experience of discovering important wedding details through engaging visual elements.
